            <p>Pomchi Club of America approved a standard for the Pomchi on June 18, 1998. The hybrid is recognized by the American Canine Hybrid Club, the Designer Dogs Kennel Club, the International Designer Canine Registry, and the Designer Breed Registry. </p></aside></div>

                <p>The Pomchi can weigh anywhere from 5-12 pounds and reach about 6-9 inches in height. The head is a rounded wedge with round, large, dark, non-protruding eyes, medium size ears, and a black nose. The tail is moderately long and looped over the back with the tip just touching the back. A Pomchi's coat may be short haired like the Chihuahua's, long like the Pomeranian's, or somewhere in between. Pomchis come in a variety of colors.</p>
                <p>As a hybrid, the Pomchi's temperment may vary. Typically, they are good lap dogs as they are very affectionate with their owners and do not require much exercise besides what they get on their own from day to day. However, they do like to get out and go for a long walk every once and a while. Like their parent breeds they are eager to please and easy to train. They are better as indoor dogs and are sutiable for small living spaces like apartments or townhouses. As a small breed, they may be too fragile for rough play with owners or larger dogs. Pomchis may not be able to tolerate small children. </p></article></div>
